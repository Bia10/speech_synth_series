00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,240
Good evening!

2
00:00:00,807 --> 00:00:04,517
Let’s talk about Finnish
language for a moment.

3
00:00:04,517 --> 00:00:05,517
More specifically,

4
00:00:05,517 --> 00:00:09,347
let’s focus on the phonemes
of the Finnish language.

5
00:00:09,347 --> 00:00:11,387
In Finnish,
there are eight vowels:

6
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:14,320
a, e, i, o,
u, y, ä and ö.

7
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,610
Each of these vowels is always
spelled with the same letter,

8
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:21,280
so when you read
this symbol, ⟨o⟩,

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,710
it is always
pronounced /o/.

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,710
No exceptions.

11
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:27,940
Sometimes there can be two
of these letters in row,

12
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:29,490
like this: ⟨oo⟩.

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,420
This means a long vowel.

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,650
Basically you just stretch
the vowel a bit: /oː/.

15
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,430
The length is
not exact science.

16
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:39,790
What is important is that
the vowel sound does not change.

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,340
For instance, it does
not become /oʊ/.

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,770
If you pronounce the long
vowel as a diphthong,

19
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:48,140
your foreign background
is exposed sooner –

20
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,270
than you can close your mouth.

21
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,500
Thus, Finnish has short
vowels and long vowels.

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,790
a, aa, e, ee, i, ii, o, oo,
u, uu, y, yy, ä, ää, ö, öö.

23
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:01,240
When two different vowels
come in sequence,

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,769
like in the word “koe”,

25
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:05,550
the two vowels are both
pronounced individually.

26
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,780
“Koe”.

27
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,839
In real life though,
Finnish has many diphtongs,

28
00:01:09,839 --> 00:01:14,280
but these are spontaneous
observations rather than rules,

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,019
and it is perfectly
fine to ignore them.

30
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:19,729
We can also ignore
the long vowels,

31
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:21,970
because it is basically
just the same vowel –

32
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,680
repeated twice in a row,
making it twice as long.

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,500
As a general rule,

34
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,240
the vowel sound is unaffected
by the consonant –

35
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,250
that precedes or follows it.

36
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,120
If you nasalize the vowel
right before a consonant,

37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,979
your Swedish background
becomes immediately apparent.

38
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:08,764
The rest of phonemes
are consonants.

39
00:03:08,764 --> 00:03:11,323
The only trill
consonant is r.

40
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:16,253
The approximants
are v, l and j.

41
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:19,644
The nasal consonants
are n and m,

42
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:22,274
but there is also
the ng sound /ŋ/,

43
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:23,774
which is an exception,

44
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:25,774
because it is the only
sound in Finnish –

45
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:28,363
that is denoted by a
sequence of two letters –

46
00:03:28,363 --> 00:03:31,194
and does not have
its own symbol.

47
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:35,234
The fricative consonants
are s and h.

48
00:03:35,234 --> 00:03:38,414
The phoneme f occurs
in loan words,

49
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:41,114
but it is not natively
a part of Finnish.

50
00:03:41,114 --> 00:03:43,104
There is just
one sibilant,

51
00:03:43,104 --> 00:03:46,844
and it is the voiceless
alveolar sibilant, /s/.

52
00:03:46,844 --> 00:03:51,734
The post-alveolar sibilant /ʃ/
occurs in some loan words,

53
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:54,734
and there is actually a letter
in the Finnish alphabet for it,

54
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:59,034
but most Finns cannot pronounce
this sound without practice.

55
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:01,964
The sibilant sounds
are never voiced.

56
00:04:01,964 --> 00:04:06,684
Most Finns cannot even pronounce
sounds like /z/ and /ʒ/ –

57
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:08,134
without practice.

58
00:04:08,134 --> 00:04:09,844
If you use those sounds,

59
00:04:09,844 --> 00:04:13,524
the listener immediately guesses
your background is Slavic.

60
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:15,694
All of the above
are like vowels,

61
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:18,494
in that they can be
either short or long.

62
00:04:18,494 --> 00:04:23,104
For example, keno, kenno,
kisa, kissa, tuli, and tulli –

63
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:24,884
are different words,

64
00:04:24,884 --> 00:04:27,034
These six words all
have different meanings –

65
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,544
that have nothing in common.

66
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:31,544
Again, the length
is not exact science;

67
00:04:31,544 --> 00:04:34,074
as long as it is clear
from your speech,

68
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:36,884
that the phoneme is
slightly longer than normal,

69
00:04:36,884 --> 00:04:38,864
it counts as a long phoneme.

70
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:40,244
It is important to note —

71
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:42,864
that it is entirely
a timing issue,

72
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:45,894
not an emphasis
or stress issue.

73
00:04:45,894 --> 00:04:50,454
Well, there are no words
with a long v or a long j,

74
00:04:50,454 --> 00:04:52,084
but if there were,

75
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:55,324
all Finns would know
how to pronounce them.

76
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:57,604
Finally there are
plosive consonants:

77
00:04:57,604 --> 00:05:00,394
The unvoiced k, p, and t,

78
00:05:00,394 --> 00:05:03,674
and their voiced counterparts,
g, b, and d.

79
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:08,584
However, b and g sounds only
occur in words of foreign origin,

80
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:13,304
and some dialects do not
recognize the voiced plosives at all.

81
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:16,614
In Finnish, the plosives
are not aspirated,

82
00:05:16,614 --> 00:05:22,014
so instead of khaptheeni,
you would say kapteeni.

83
00:05:22,014 --> 00:05:24,454
If you aspirate your consonants,

84
00:05:24,454 --> 00:05:28,234
the listener immediately guesses
your background is English.

85
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:30,834
The plosives can also
be short or long.

86
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:35,504
For example, kuka, kukka,
mato, matto, rapu and rappu –

87
00:05:35,504 --> 00:05:36,864
are all different words,

88
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:39,714
with meanings that
have nothing in common.

89
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,943
Because the plosive consonants
are characterized –

90
00:05:41,943 --> 00:05:44,573
by a sudden sound that
follows a silence,

91
00:05:44,573 --> 00:05:47,323
the difference between
a short and long plosive –

92
00:05:47,323 --> 00:05:51,064
is how long the air
is held before released.

93
00:05:51,064 --> 00:05:53,474
Finally there is the
glottal stop, /ʔ/.

94
00:05:53,474 --> 00:05:56,424
This sound occurs sometimes
before a vowel –

95
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,964
when the speaker
wants to be clear –

96
00:05:57,964 --> 00:06:00,823
where the syllable break
or word break is,

97
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:03,503
or to emphasize
the beginning of a word.

98
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:07,223
Example, “mä en halua”
means I don’t want,

99
00:06:07,223 --> 00:06:12,103
but “mä’en halua” means
I really don’t want.

100
00:06:12,103 --> 00:06:14,573
Sometimes the exact quality
of the consonant can change –

101
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:17,214
depending on the
following phonemes.

102
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:21,464
For example, if an "n" letter
is followed by a "p" letter,

103
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:25,734
almost everyone pronounces
it as "m" instead of "n".

104
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:29,623
For example, "kumpa"
instead of "kunpa".

105
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:32,973
If the "n" letter is followed
by a "k" letter instead,

106
00:06:32,973 --> 00:06:36,183
most readers pronounce
it as "ng",

107
00:06:36,183 --> 00:06:38,323
for example "ongko"
instead of "onko".

108
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:42,654
The “h” letter can be pronounced
in a number of different ways –

109
00:06:42,654 --> 00:06:45,654
depending on the
surrounding vowels.

110
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:48,814
Examples: “pehmeä”, “lahja”, “pihvi”.

111
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:52,334
Each of these were articulated
in a different part of the mouth.

112
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:57,454
These three phonemes are called
allophones for the phoneme “h”,

113
00:06:57,454 --> 00:07:01,133
and most native speakers are
not even aware of the differences.

114
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:06,434
Again, these are spontaneously
arising phenomena rather than rules.

115
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:09,574
Note, that unlike in
Hebrew and English,

116
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,734
if there is a “h” in the text,

117
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:15,494
it’s a consonant, and it is
always pronounced as “h”.

118
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:18,054
There are no silent letters in Finnish.

119
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:21,434
There is one curious exception,
namely gemination.

120
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:22,674
In some cases,

121
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:26,334
a consonant is pronounced long
even if it’s written short.

122
00:07:26,334 --> 00:07:31,814
For example, instead of “syö hernekeittoa”
you would say “syö hhernekkeittoa”.

123
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:33,994
I’m not totally sure why this happens.

124
00:07:33,994 --> 00:07:35,754
It just does.

125
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:39,114
It is not something that could cause
misunderstandings either way,

126
00:07:39,114 --> 00:07:41,114
but a curious detail nonetheless.

127
00:07:41,114 --> 00:07:44,694
Note that you can’t just go randomly
duplicating phonemes.

128
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:48,594
If you pronounced “älä menekkään”
as “älämmenekkään”,

129
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:50,114
the listener would have to do –

130
00:07:50,194 --> 00:07:52,934
a double take to understand
what you just said.

131
00:07:52,934 --> 00:07:55,074
A little bit about timings.

132
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:58,874
Different languages have different ideas
about how speech is timed.

133
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:01,854
In English and Swedish,
for example,

134
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:06,014
the time between consecutive
stressed syllables is fairly constant.

135
00:08:06,014 --> 00:08:09,814
In French, each syllable takes
roughly the same time.

136
00:08:09,814 --> 00:08:13,414
In Japanese, each syllable also
takes roughly the same time,

137
00:08:13,414 --> 00:08:19,094
except that syllables with a long vowel are
pronounced twice as long as regular syllables.

138
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:21,094
But Finnish is not like that.

139
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:23,014
Finnish is different.

140
00:08:23,014 --> 00:08:26,354
Basically, each phoneme,
represented by a single letter,

141
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:28,354
takes a constant time.

142
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:33,174
Long phonemes are represented by two letters,
and they take twice the time.

143
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:35,334
There are a few exceptions though.

144
00:08:35,334 --> 00:08:39,894
Again, things that just rise
spontaneously from practice.

145
00:08:39,974 --> 00:08:41,514
So, to recap:

146
00:08:41,514 --> 00:08:44,214
Eight vowels,
and about twelve consonants.

147
00:08:44,474 --> 00:08:47,694
Phonetically Finnish is quite
a simple language.

148
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:51,654
This is the phonetic vocabulary
that a Finnish person has,

149
00:08:51,654 --> 00:08:53,414
when they speak
any foreign language.

150
00:08:53,414 --> 00:08:56,594
As I explained
in another video,

151
00:08:56,614 --> 00:09:00,614
whichever phonetic background a person
has from their native language –

152
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:03,634
largely determines what
kind of accent they have –

153
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:05,594
when speaking another language.

154
00:09:05,654 --> 00:09:08,454
The simplicity of Finnish phonetics
contributes to –

155
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,834
the quite recognizable accent
that Finnish people often have –

156
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:12,994
when they speak a language –

157
00:09:12,994 --> 00:09:16,394
that has phonetically a
significantly different makeup,

158
00:09:16,394 --> 00:09:17,794
such as English.

159
00:09:17,794 --> 00:09:21,914
We may be revisiting this topic
soon in another video.

160
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:25,874
Stay tuned, and have
a shalom in your life.
