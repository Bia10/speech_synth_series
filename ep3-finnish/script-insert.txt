If you have studied German language,
you should notice something familiar here.
	[slide 34]
German is not related to Finnish in the least,
but the set of vowels still
happens to be very similar to German.

	[slide 35]
Particularly, Finnish has these two letters,
just like the German language.
	[slide 36]
But German also has this U with two dots.

	[slide 37]
The first letter, O with two dots,
is pronounced “ö”, like the vowel
in the French word “Jeûne” [zhöön],
in both languages.

The second letter,
which is the letter wai in Finnish,
but in German is written as U with
two dots, is pronounced “y”,
like the vowel in the French word “tu”.

The third letter, the A with two dots,
differs from its value in German.
In Finnish, it is pronounced the same
way as the alif in Arabic word “كتاب” (kitääb).
	[slide 38]
Or as the vowel in the Russian word “пять” (pjätj).

	[slide 39 fade to]
But the more important difference
is that you can NEVER replace
these letters with a two-vowel
sequence where the second vowel is E.
It’s ok in German, but very, very wrong in Finnish.

	[slide 40]
For example, consider this name.
Kyösti Käyhkö.

If you try to spell it like some
	[slide 41]
1980s graphics system for sports broadcasts,
you get KUEOESTI KAEUEHKOE instead.

	[repeat both twice with highpass filter]
	[cue ball pocket sfx]

So, never do that. Never.
