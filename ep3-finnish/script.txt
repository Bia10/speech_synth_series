Hyvää iltaa!

The primary building
blocks of speech
are called phonemes.

	[slide 2]
Let’s talk about
Finnish language for a moment.
	[use slide 27, zoom, change to slide 3 with sfx]
More specifically,
let’s focus on the phonemes
of the Finnish language.

	[fade to slide 4]
In Finnish, there are eight vowels:
	[slides 5 and 6; use alpha mask to reveal each letter]
a, e, i, o, u, y, ä and ö.
	[subtly fade slide 7 at some point, fade back to slide 6]

In Finnish, each of these vowels is always
spelled with the same letter,
so when you read this symbol,
	[slide 8]
	[o]
it is always pronounced “o”. No exceptions.
Sometimes there can be two of these letters in row, like this:
	[slide 9]
	[oo]
this means a long vowel.
Basically you just stretch the vowel a bit: “oo”.
The length is not exact science.
What is important is that the vowel sound does not change.
	[slide 10]
For instance, it does not become [oʊ].

If you pronounce the long vowel as a diphthong,
your foreign background is exposed sooner
than you can close your mouth.
	[slide 11]
Thus, Finnish has short vowels and long vowels.

	a aa
	e ee
	i ii
	o oo
	u uu
	y yy
	ä ää
	ö öö

When two different vowels come in sequence,
	[slide 12]
like in the word “koe”,
the two vowels are both pronounced individually.
“koe”.

	[green-screen scroll slide 13 from down]
In real life though,
Finnish has many diphtongs,
but these are spontaneous observations
rather than rules,
	[scroll it out to down, use piu sound effect]
and it is perfectly fine to ignore them.

	[fade to slide 14, then 15, then 16]
We can also ignore the long vowels,
because it is basically just the same vowel
repeated twice in a row,
making it twice as long.

As a general rule, the vowel sound
is unaffected by the consonant
that precedes or follows it.
	[slide 17]
If you nasalize the vowel right before a consonant,
your Swedish background becomes immediately apparent.

	[fade to slide 5, then change to slide 18]
The rest of phonemes are consonants.

	[slide 19: use alpha mask to reveal sections, base: slide 18]
The only trill consonant is r.

The approximants are v, l and j.

The nasal consonants are n and m,
but there is also the ng sound
which is an exception because it is the only
sound in Finnish that is denoted
by a sequence of two letters
and does not have its own symbol.

The fricative consonants are s and h.
	[use kdenlive effect to highlight f]
The phoneme f occurs in loan words,
but it is not natively part of Finnish.

	[use kdenlive effect to highlight s]
There is just one sibilant,
and it is the voiceless alveolar sibilant, [ss].
	[use kdenlive effect to highlight š]
The post-alveolar sibilant [ʃ] occurs in some loan words,
and there is actually a letter in the Finnish alphabet for it,
but most Finns cannot pronounce this sound without practice.

	[slide 19 still; reveal the "not in finnish" part]
	[use kdenlive effect to highlight z and ʒ]
The sibilant sounds are never voiced.
Most Finns cannot even pronounce sounds
like [z] and [ʒ] without practice.
If you use those sounds, the listener
immediately guesses your background is Slavic.

	[unreveal the "not in finnish" part]
All of the above are like vowels,
in that they can be either short or long.

	[slide 20]
For example, keno, kenno, kisa, kissa,
tuli, and tulli are different words,
These six words all have different meanings
that have nothing in common.

Again, the length is not exact science;
as long as it is clear from your speech
that the phoneme is slightly longer than normal,
it counts as a long phoneme.

It is important to note
that it is entirely a timing issue,
not an emphasis or stress issue.

	[slide 21]
Well, there are no words with a long v or a long j,
but if there were,
all Finns would know how to pronounce them.

	[slide 22: use alpha mask to reveal sections, base: slide 21]
Finally there are plosive consonants:

The unvoiced k, p, and t,
and their voiced counterparts, g, b, and d.
However, b and g sounds only occur in words
of foreign origin, and some dialects do not
recognize the voiced plosives at all.

	[slide 22 still; reveal the "kapteeni" part]
In Finnish, the plosives are not aspirated,
so instead of khaptheeni, you would say kapteeni.
Aspirate your consonants, and the listener
immediately guesses your background is English.

	[slide 23]
The plosives can also be short or long.
For example, kuka, kukka, mato, matto,
rapu and rappu are all different words,
with meanings that have nothing in common.

Because the plosive consonants are characterized
by a sudden sound that follows a silence,
the difference between a short and long plosive
is how long the air is held before released.

	[slide 24]
Finally there is the glottal stop, [ʔ].
This sound occurs sometimes before a vowel
when the speaker wants to be clear
where the syllable break or word break is,
or to emphasize the beginning of a word.

Example, “mä en halua” means I don’t want,
but “mä’en halua” means I really don’t want.

	[slide 25]
Sometimes the exact quality of the consonant
can change depending on the following phonemes.

For example, if an "n" letter is followed by a "p" letter,
almost everyone pronounces it as "m" instead of "n".
For example, "kumpa" instead of "kunpa".
If the "n" letter is followed by a "k" letter instead,
most readers pronounce it as "ng",
for example "ongko" instead of "onko".

The “h” letter can be pronounced in a number of different ways
depending on the surrounding vowels.
Examples: “pehmeä”, “lahja”, “pihvi”.
Each of these were articulated in a different part of the mouth.
These three phonemes are called allophones for the phoneme “h”,
and most native speakers are not even aware of the differences.

Again, these are spontaneously arising phenomena
rather than rules.

	[slide 28]
| Note that if unlike in Hebrew and English,
| if there is a “h” in the text,
| it’s a consonant and it is always pronounced as “h”.
| There are no silent letters in Finnish.

	[slide 29]
There is one curious exception, namely gemination.
In some cases, a consonant is pronounced long
even if it’s written short.
For example, instead of “syö hernekeittoa”
you would say “syö hhernekkeittoa”.
I’m not totally sure why this happens.
It just does.
It is not something that could cause
misunderstandings either way,
but a curious detail nonetheless.

	[slide 30]
Note that you can’t just go randomly
duplicating phonemes.
If you pronounced “älä menekkään”
as “älämmenekkään”, the listener
would have to do a double take
to understand what you just said.

	[slides 5 & 31, rotoscope to reveal things]
A little bit about timings.
Different languages have different ideas
about how speech is timed.

** In English and Svenska, 
In English and Swedish, for example,
the time between
consecutive stressed syllables
is fairly constant.

** In lö fRase, 
In French, each syllable takes
roughly the same time.

In Japanese, each syllable also
takes roughly the same time,
except that syllables with a long vowel
are pronounced twice as long
as regular syllables.

	[slides 5 & 32, rotoscope]
But Finnish is not like that.
Finnish is different.

Basically, each phoneme,
represented by a single letter,
takes a constant time.
Long phonemes are represented
by two letters, and they take
twice the time.

There are a few exceptions though.
Again, things that
just rise spontaneously
from practice.

	[slide 26]
So, to recap:
Eight vowels, and about twelve consonants.

Phonetically Finnish is quite
a simple language.

This is the phonetic vocabulary
that a Finnish person has,
when they speak
any foreign language.

As I explained in another video,
whichever phonetic background a person
has from their native language
largely determines what kind of accent
they have when speaking another language.

The simplicity of Finnish phonetics
contributes to the quite recognizable
accent Finnish people often have
when they speak a language that
has phonetically a significantly different makeup,
such as English.

We may be revisiting this topic
soon in another video.

Stay tuned,
and have a shalom in your life.
